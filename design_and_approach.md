# Design and Approach for AI-Powered Job Matching and Resume Tailoring System

## Overview

Users upload their resume and specify job preferences such as desired profiles (SDE, Product, Tester, Frontend, Backend), minimum salary, preferred location, etc. The system scrapes jobs daily from sources like Google Jobs and LinkedIn, then filters and selects the top 5 best-matched jobs per user based on their preferences. AI reads each job description, tailors the userâ€™s resume to optimize for the job ensuring an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score above 75%, and stores the tailored resume with the job details. Users are notified via the portal to review and apply manually, since full auto-apply is challenging.

## Components

### 1. User Input \& Profile Management

- Resume upload and parsing module
- Preferences input form (profiles, salary, locations)
- User profile and preferences database


### 2. Job Scraping \& Aggregation

- Scraper modules for Google Jobs, LinkedIn, and other portals
- Daily scheduled scraping with anti-bot handling
- Data normalization and storage in a job listings database


### 3. Job Filtering \& Matching

- Filter jobs per user preferences
- Relevance scoring algorithm for jobs
- Select top 5 matches daily for each user


### 4. AI-Driven Resume Tailoring

- NLP model to analyze job description for key skills and keywords
- Resume tailoring engine to customize content and format
- ATS scoring system to ensure match score > 75%


### 5. Storage \& Notification

- Store tailored resumes linked to corresponding jobs
- Notification system to alert users about new tailored resumes and matched jobs


### 6. User Interface \& Application Flow

- Dashboard for matched jobs and tailored resumes
- Easy access for users to review and download tailored resumes with job details
- Manual apply reminders and guidance

## Technology Considerations

- Resume parsing: PDF/Doc parsers combined with NLP techniques
- Scraping: Web scraping frameworks with anti-bot measures, and APIs if available
- AI Tailoring: Transformer-based NLP models (e.g., GPT, BERT) fine-tuned for resume tailoring
- ATS Scoring: Integration with popular ATS simulators or in-house ATS scoring models
- Backend: RESTful API with SQL/NoSQL databases for users and jobs
- Frontend: Responsive web UI using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue

## Workflow Summary

1. User uploads base resume and provides preferences
2. System scrapes job boards daily
3. Jobs are filtered based on preferences
4. AI tailors the resume for each job ensuring ATS match
5. Tailored resumes are stored and user is notified
6. User visits portal to review and apply manually

## Challenges and Future Enhancements

- Avoiding IP blocking and ensuring robust scraping
- Accurate ATS scoring that reflects real-world ATS systems
- Supporting diverse resume formats and possibly multiple languages
- Considering auto-apply integration when feasible
- Adding enhanced notifications via email, SMS, or mobile app

This structured approach balances automation with user control, leveraging AI for resume customization while respecting current auto-application limitations. It focuses on user convenience by curating and tailoring opportunities daily, with clear and actionable notifications.
